## Goal: 

</u>
</center>

### Our goal for this assignment was to create an application used to write, save, and delete notes. I used an express backend save and retrieve not data from a JSON file. We created HTML and API routes to store and retrieve notes.

<br>


Through this assignment, I learned alot of things that go into creating the backend of a web application. It has been harder to master than the front end, but I believe that over time it will become more second nature. I really like the practicality of it, and how there are so many ways to solve each problem.

<br>



## Criteria:

Within this file, I included:

<center>

```
1. Functional deployed application
2. Express
3. Javascript     
4. Node.js     
     
 ```

</center>

<u>

## Issues with the project:

</u>

<br>

- Figuring out how to correctly organize and utlitize the backend.

    -  Getting help from TAs definitely made a huge differece, and the postioning of each function was extremely imortant to figure out.
