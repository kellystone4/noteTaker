</center>

### Our goal for this assignment was to create an application used to write, save, and delete notes. I used an express backend save and retrieve not data from a JSON file. We created HTML and API routes to store and retrieve notes.

<br>


Through this assignment, I learned alot of things that go into creating the backend of a web application. 

<br>



## Criteria:

Within this file, I included:

<center>

```
1. Functional deployed application
2. Consistent navbar on each page 
3. Navbar with links attached     
4. Usage of semantic html/css     
5. Utilization of Bootstrap       
6. Personalized information       
 ```

## Issues with the project:

</u>

<br>

- Figuring out how to push the About Me, Portfolio and Contact over to the right side while keeping the rest to the left

    -  I solved this issue by putting the section with my name in it's own class so that my ml-auto code was only affecting the elements I wanted to move over to the left hand side of the header.

- Making the text wrap around my "About Me" image. This was probably the issue that was the most frustrating to fix. 

    - To fix this, I realized all I needed was to add a simple 'float' to my image. This would make the text wrap around the image. Then, I added a margin to add space between my image and text. Below is an image of how it looked before and after I wrapped the text around the image (along with several other changes).
